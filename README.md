## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Plain CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Similarly to the previous challenge I completed, I worked with flex properties and adjusted the card component depending on the screen size. I used the content property and feel more confident using this concept to change the image within media queries. Also, I used another concept of opacity to make the image look purple. Overall, I enjoyed the design of the desktop version and had fun aligning the text accurately to the design.

Opacity and content property - code: 

```css

.img-holder {
    background-color: var(--soft-violet);
    border-radius: 7px 7px 0 0;
}

.img {
    content: url(/images/image-header-mobile.jpg);
    width: 100%;
    border-radius: 7px 7px 0 0;
    opacity: 0.5;
}

```

### Continued development

For future developments, I should learn more about css grids and begin learning the fundamentals of javascript to apply those concepts into my future challenges.
